# 🧮 Matrix Calculator

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project implements a Python-based matrix calculator capable of performing matrix operations like addition, multiplication, and computing eigenvalues.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to `projects/Matrix-Calculator/`.
3. Run the script `matrix_calculator.py` to start the calculator.

## 🚀 Usage Guide
- Use the command line interface to perform matrix operations.
- Example: `python matrix_calculator.py --operation add --matrix1 1,2,3;4,5,6 --matrix2 6,5,4;3,2,1`

## 🗂️ Code Structure
- `matrix_calculator.py`: Main script for matrix operations.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the calculator.

## ✅ Testing
- Run `python -m unittest discover tests` to execute tests.

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Currently supports only 2D matrices.
- Future improvements could include support for higher-dimensional matrices.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Expand the calculator to support additional matrix operations.
- Improve the user interface for better usability.
